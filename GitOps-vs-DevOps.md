# DevOps vs GitOps: A Real-Life Example

## Example: Deploying a Web Application

Imagine you're part of a development team responsible for building and deploying a web application. The application consists of frontend and backend components, and it needs to be deployed to a cloud infrastructure.

## DevOps Approach

1. **Collaboration:** The developers, operations engineers, and testers work together to define the deployment process and infrastructure requirements.

2. **Automation:** A CI/CD pipeline is set up using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI. Developers push their code changes to a version control repository (e.g., Git), triggering the CI/CD pipeline.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI):** Upon code changes being pushed, the CI system automatically builds, tests, and packages the application.

4. **Continuous Deployment (CD):** After successful CI, the CD part of the pipeline deploys the application to different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) based on predefined rules. Tools like Ansible or Kubernetes are used to manage infrastructure and deployments.

5. **Monitoring and Feedback:** Monitoring tools are integrated to track the application's health and performance in production. If issues arise, the development and operations teams collaborate to identify and address the problems.

6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Infrastructure setups are managed using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation, allowing for versioned and repeatable infrastructure deployment.

## GitOps Approach

1. **Declarative Infrastructure:** Infrastructure configurations are stored in a Git repository. This repository contains files that describe the desired state of the application and its infrastructure.

2. **Version-Controlled Changes:** When changes are needed (e.g., scaling the backend service), an operations engineer makes a pull request to the Git repository, updating the declarative configurations.

3. **Automated Reconciliation:** A GitOps tool, like ArgoCD or Flux, monitors the Git repository for changes. When a change is detected, the tool automatically reconciles the current state of the infrastructure with the desired state defined in the Git repository.

4. **Immutable Deployments:** When a change is merged into the Git repository, the GitOps tool enforces the desired state. It might create new instances of services or modify existing ones, following the immutable infrastructure principle.

5. **Continuous Delivery from Git:** The entire deployment process is triggered by Git commits and pull requests. The operations team doesn't need direct access to production servers; changes are made through code changes.

6. **Auditing and Compliance:** All changes are logged in the Git repository, providing a transparent history of who made what changes and when. This is helpful for auditing and compliance purposes.
